abstract: "Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) can rapidly accumulate to form invisible pollution hotspots, posing significant health risks due to its odorless and colorless nature. Despite growing interest in wearable or stationary sensors for pollutant detection, effectively visualizing CO2 levels and engaging individuals remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we develop a portable wrist-sized pollution sensor that detects CO2 in real time at any indoor location and reveals CO2 bubbles by highlighting sudden spikes. In order to promote better ventilation habits and user awareness, we also develop a smartphone-based augmented reality (AR) game for users to locate and disperse these high-CO2 zones. A user study with 35 participants demonstrated increased engagement and heightened understanding of CO2’s health impacts. Our system’s usability evaluations yielded a median score of 1.88, indicating its strong practicality."
