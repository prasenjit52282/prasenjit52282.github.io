The Award for Inclusion Research (AIR) Program supported innovative research and professors working to create positive societal impact.

* AIR funded research projects that promote the society-centered research approach to shape the positive outcomes of AI for a better future. We are seeking research proposals that advance AI applications relating to accessibility, health care, cultural production, upskilling, or other topics related to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

* Project title: **AI-assisted Distributed Collaborative Indoor Pollution Meters: A Case Study, Requirement Analysis, and Low-cost Healthy Home Solution for Indian Slums** -- Sandip Chakraborty (PhD Advisor), IIT Kharagpur
